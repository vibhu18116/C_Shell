# C_Shell

Shell is a basic program run by the OS to help user perform many functions like reading
a file, creating a file, listing all files in directory, changing directory, install packages,
update them, and much more.

This code implements a Shell from scratch, which executes the external commands and also handles nested pipes and IO redirection.

To execute the code:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory and open a terminal.
3. Run `make`
4. Run `./syscall`
5. Enjoy exploring the shell.
